# Module 5 Challenge
The project was used to take data from mice with tumours and inject medicine; the project was used to give visuals to make it easier to understand.
Stephen Fernandes did this with the help of Stackflow(comments were added where I found the info) and from AskBsc.
The project is missing a small part with finding the duplicated data and small visual issues with the bar and box charts but everything else is there. 
The project should be ran through juptyer notebook.
